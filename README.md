BU RISE(practicum) Group L Project

# Research Question:

# How we plan to carry out our project:

(1) We plan to find existing EEG data for people with normal sleep cycles and for individuals undergoing sleepwalking episodes.
(2) Then, we plan to find a similar existing machine learning model for diagnosing sleep disorders to adapt our model from. Or if no such model is available, we plan to write our own based on the methods of similar existing studies.
(3) After completing our model, we plan to have the model learn both sets of data and to be able to differentiate between them and identify the sleepwalking episodes when fed new data. 
(4) Finally, we will determine the percent accuracy of the algorithm.
