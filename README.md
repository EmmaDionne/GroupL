EEG Data: these are EEG data sets we have found so far, but we still need sleepwalking specific EEG data (with the exception of one article with this data) as well as more sleep cycle specific EEG’s.

Has the EEGs of people doing specific tasks (I didn’t really see any sleep-specific ones, but has a lot of data)
